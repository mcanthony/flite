# Change Log

This file documents the changes made to the flite project in order to comply
with clause 2 of the project's [BSD license](COPYING).

Add and modernize the standard project files:

  * Added a CHANGELOG.md file to track the project changes.
  * Added the COPYING file from the 1.1 upstream release.

Generate the autotools files instead of using old versions:

  * Added an autogen.sh script to setup the configure script.
